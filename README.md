# Diffusion_MD
This is the code for the work done by Pavan Subramani during the Harvard Undergraduate OpenBio Laboratory Student Research Symposium.
The folders labeled "rep_01", "rep_02", and "rep_03" were the 3 0.8 ns replicas used in model training.
The folder labeled "hybrid" contains the 8 hybrid trajectories.
The folder labeled "classical" contains the 8 classical trajectories.
model_best.pt is the model that was used in the hybrid trajectories.
heavy_only.pdb and full.pdb are the structural files used.
The colab notebook contains all of the code used to generate the data as well as the analysis.
